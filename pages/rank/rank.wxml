        <text class="weui-media-box__desc">The ranking feature is currently facing a major problem: The Users are not being sorted by Grade. To solve this problem, The engineer(which is me typing this stuff right now lol(autism 100)) will have to do some major changes on the database, and things might get really complicated. So this problem will probably be solved after few updates instead of the next one. The next update after big versions usually comes with emergency patches.</text>
